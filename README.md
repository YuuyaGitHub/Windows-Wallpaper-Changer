# Windows Wallpaper Changer
A tool to change Windows wallpaper.

This time, I made an installer type for the first time with my software.

# Structure
I'm using WinAPI's ```SystemParametersInfo``` function.

# How to use
Enter the full path of the file you want to set as wallpaper in the text box. (Alternatively, you can browse to the file by clicking the "Browse" button)

# Appearance
